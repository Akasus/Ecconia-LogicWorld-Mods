# Ecconias Logic World Mod Collection

In this repository you will find all mods created by @Ecconia for the game `Logic World`.

## How to install / use them?

This project contains one `project folder` for each mod.\
In each of these folder you will find descriptions and further instructions like this one.\
Inside each `project folder` you will find another folder, which is the actual `mod folder`.\
You can copy/paste or `link` that `mod folder` to your `GameData` folder, where `Logic World` searches for mods.

You can ignore all other files outside of the `mod folder`s.

## WARNING (Logic World won't start!):

Currently `Logic World` struggles to compile mods, when there are more than 3 or 4 mods in the `GameData` folder.\
You have to add them one by one if it does not start.

### How to contribute / develop on these?

Download this repository or optionally a fork.\
Create a `link` named `LogicWorld` from within this projects root folder to your `Logic World` installation directory. (Probably in your Steam installations folder `[...]/steamapps/common/Logic World/`).\
Open the repository with your favorite C# IDE and hope that it works.
