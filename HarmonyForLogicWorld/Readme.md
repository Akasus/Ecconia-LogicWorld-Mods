# HarmonyForLogicWorld by @Ecconia

### Description:

This mod allows to hijack `Logic World Server` using `Harmony`, it is a library mod, which other mods can use.

It is made for the server and only runs there.

### What does it do?

It only loads the `Harmony` DLL, using the `AssemblyLoader` mod. This way Harmony is only loaded once on the server.

# Install:

Just drop the `HarmonyForServers` folder into the `GameData` folder.

You will also need the mod `AssemblyLoader` for this mod to function.\
If you are running this mod on a server, you should also install `ServerOnlyMods`, to allow players to join without this mod.\
You can find them in my mod collection (root folder).
