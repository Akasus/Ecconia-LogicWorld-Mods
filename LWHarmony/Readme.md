# LWHarmony by @FalsePattern

### Description:

This mod allows to hijack `Logic World` using `Harmony`, it is a library mod, which other mods can use.

It was written by @FalsePattern, but might contain small edits by @Ecconia.

# Install:

Just drop the `lwharmony` folder into your `GameData` folder.

You will also need the mod `DllUtil` by @FalsePattern for this mod to function.\
You can find them in my mod collection (root folder).

However, by itself this mod does not do anything. However other mods might need it. Install it when you are asked to.
