# EccsWindowHelper by @Ecconia

### Description:

This mod is a library that helps other mods to create windows, to for example edit their components.

It provides some components like Sliders/Toggles, but no Buttons (yet).

You will need some Unity experience and still have to create the window yourself. Even new components.\
But with this mod you can obtain a good understanding of how that works + use its helper functionalities.

### Issue:

This mod tries to create every GUI element from scratch.\
While LogicWorld does have a bunch of Prefabs for components somewhere in its assets, these could be extracted.\
So it might be that the component provided by this mod become outdated or in some other way behave different thant he base game.

# Install:

Just drop the `EccsWindowHelper` folder into your `GameData` folder.

However, by itself this mod does not do anything. However other mods might need it. Install it when you are asked to.
