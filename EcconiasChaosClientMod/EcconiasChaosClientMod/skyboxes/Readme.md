# How to add custom skyboxes?

Due to legal reasons, this mod does not come with a skybox delivered. Contact the developer for help or nice skyboxes.

Requirements:

- Must be a PNG image with file ending `.png`.
- Must be inside this folder!
- All 6 sides must be inside this image, in the common cross shape - the center must be on the left side.
- The width should be dividable by 4 (and not zero).
- The height must be 3/4 of the width.

Choose skybox:

In this version the skybox which comes first in the alphabet will be used (sorting of the filesystem will be used).
In general this means adding a `0` in front, will likely choose a skybox.
